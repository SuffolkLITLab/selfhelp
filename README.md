A geo-locator app can be used to search for and filter through programs and services in your area. Click the video to watch a presentation explaining what a geo-locator app does and why it can be useful. This repository was created to help you create your own version of Suffolk LIT Lab's geo-locator website application, which can be found [here.](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map/) Here are the steps to create your own geo-locator website application:
**<p> 1. Head to https://github.com/ and create your own account. </p>**
**<p> 2. Once you've created an account, go to https://github.com/SuffolkLITLab/resource-map-how-to. </p>**
**<p> 3. Click on the index.html file. </p>**
**<p> 4. Click the pen button to edit the code. You will have to verify your GitHub account via email before editing anything.</p>**

**<p> 12. Go to a different tab/window. Create an Airtable account [here](https://airtable.com). Airtable will be free since this app will likely not be used for commerical purposes. </p>**
 
![Image of Airtable sign in](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Airtable%20sign%20in.png)

![Image of Locations](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Locations.png) 
**<p> 15. Under the "locations" tab, include the name, latitude & longitude coordinates, and zoom for each location. To find the latitude & longitude, you can use this [website](https://www.latlong.net). To add the zoom, add a comma then a number (i.e. ,13 ,14 ,15) to the end of coordinates. </p>**

**<p> 18. Conduct research on the programs you want to include. Begin inputting your own data into the Airtable. </p>**
**<p> 19. Turn to the index.html file. Click the pen button to edit. Update lines 7 & 34 to create your own title. </p>**

![Image of 73](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/73.png)
**<p> 23. Update line 142 to input your own Category names. Make sure the Category names are spelled exactly as they are in the Airtable to ensure the data is inputted correctly into the code. Tag the categories as you want to refer to them throughout the code (i.e. "Alternative" "Risk"). </p>** 

![Image of 142](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/142.png)

**<p> 24. Put the tagged names into line 208 (i.e: checkbox-v-Alternative'). </p>**

![Image of 140](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/140.png)

**<p> 29. Find your Google Maps API. To find your Google Maps API go [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key?refresh=1) and follow the steps below. You will have to sign into Google using a gmail account. Once you're signed in, click "Get Started" </p>**

![Image Line Google API 1](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Google%20API%201.png)

**<p> 30. Choose the Maps selection. Click "Continue." </p>**
![Image Line Google API 1.2](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Google%20API%201.2.png)

**<p> 31. Click "My Project" or create a new one. </p>**
![Image Line Google API 1.3](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Google%20API%201.3.png)

**<p> 32. Google will then ask you to enable billing. Even though you must input a credit card, Google gives $200 a month of free use. It is more likely than not that you will still not reach the $200 threshold because the app will likely be for internal use with only a few dozen people utilizing it. For more info on this, you can click [here.](https://mapsplatform.googleblog.com/2018/05/introducing-google-maps-platform.html) Click "Create Billing Account." </p>**

![Image Line Google API 1.4](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Google%20API%201.4.png)
![Image Line Google billing](http://suffolklitlab.org/resource-map-how-to/README%20images/Google%20billing.png)

**<p> 33. Input your credit card info then hit "Submit and Enable." </p>**
**<p> 34. Your Google API key should then generate. Copy the Google API key and turn to line 136 of the code. Paste your own Google API key. </p>**
