  <h1><a name="top" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#top" class="anchor"></a>Family Law Glossary</h1>
  <p>
    The purpose of this document is to better educate you of the fault grounds for divorce 
    so you will be able to choose the one that is right for your situation.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Adultery" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Adultery" class="anchor"></a>Adultery</h2>
  <p>
    This Fault ground is reserved for those whose marriage has broken down due to an unfaithful spouse. 
    The spouse may have broken their vows by engaging in any sort of sexual relations with someone outside of the marriage. You will need to prove this in court.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Desertion" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Desertion" class="anchor"></a>Desertion</h2>
  <p>
    This fault ground is reserved for those whose spouse has left them without any explanation 
    and has remained away for a period of time longer than one year. You will need to prove this in court.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Imprisonment" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Imprisonment" class="anchor"></a>Imprisonment</h2>
  <p>
    This fault ground is reserved for those whose spouse was convicted of a crime and was 
    sentenced to a prison term of five years or more. You will need to prove this in court.
  </p>
	
 <h2><a name="Impotency" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Impotency" class="anchor"></a>Impotency</h2>
  <p>
    This fault ground is reserved for those who entered into a marriage with the expectation of having children, 
    and found out after that their spouse was unable to produce offspring. You will need to prove this in court
  </p>

 <h2><a name="Cruel and Abusive Treatment" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Cruel_and_Abusive_Treatment" class="anchor"></a>Cruel and Abusive Treatment</h2>
  <p>
    This fault ground is reserved for someone who has suffered physical or emotional abuse by their spouse. 
    This abuse would have to have been so great as to cause some sort of physical impact whether it be a bruise or 
    cut, or a diagnosed mental condition. You will need to prove this abuse and impact in court. 
  </p>

 <h2><a name="Failure to Support" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Failure_to_Support" class="anchor"></a>Failure to SUpport</h2>
  <p>
    This fault ground is reserved for those whose spouse is unwilling to provide financial support 
    for their spouse and/or family.
  </p>
	
 <h2><a name="Habitual Intoxication" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Habitual_Intoxication" class="anchor"></a>Habitual Intoxication</h2>
  <p>
    This fault ground is reserved for those whose spouse has shown to have a consistent habit 
    of being heavily intoxicated either by using drugs like opiates or alcohol. You will need 
    to prove this in court.
  </p>

 <h2><a name="Irretrievable Breakdown" href="https://suffolklitlab.org/selfhelp/family_glossary.html#Irretrievable_Breakdown" class="anchor"></a>None of the Above / Irretrievable Breakdown</h2>
  <p>
    If none of these fault grounds fit your situation or you do not wish to have to prove ay of these in court, 
    you can still obtain a “no fault” divorce by claiming your marriage has suffered an irretrievable breakdown. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This is a “no fault” ground that can be used by a spouse to obtain a divorce. It does not designate blame on 
    either spouse, nor do you have to prove anything in court.  Most marriages are now “no fault” divorces.  
    It simply means that your marriage is no longer working and it can not be fixed.
